# CodeNN

This is Encog-powered neural network app made for AI course at Silesian University of Technology. It recognizes programming language based on provided snippet. Made first with Grails, then rewritten to use Spark web framework because of performance issues. Hefty chunk of Encog-specific code is ripped off from official "neural network's hello world (XOR prediction)" and works somewhat ok.
